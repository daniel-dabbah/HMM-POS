I submit the following files:
1. ex2.py with the following classes:

Class Mle:
this class corresponds to the most likely tag baseline model.

Class BigramHmm:
this class corresponds to the bigram HMM tagger.
the class can receive paramters that represent the desired behavior.
the parapmetrs can be "add one smoothing", and threshold number.
if the threshold number is different then 0,
its means we will use Pseudo Wordo, with the matching threshold.

ex2.py contains the main function that run all the matching questions.

2. confusion_matrix_plot.png that contains full size figure of the
confusion matrix.
